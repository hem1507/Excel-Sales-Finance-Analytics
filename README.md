# AtliQ Hardware Sales Insight

##### In this project, I've replicated a scenario addressing a problem for a hardware company based in India.

### AtliQ Hardware
#####   - AtliQ is a hardware company which supplies computer hardware and peripherals to many clients across the Globe. AtliQ supplies products through 3 main channels namely, ecommerce, computer peripheral dealers and direct channel. Its customer base includes ecommerce giants like Amazon, Flipkart, Croma, BestBuy, etc.

### Business Issue
###### Scenario: The Sales Director requires a comprehensive overview of all operations, and the data provided by Regional Sales Managers falls short. Simply receiving numbers or sifting through numerous Excel files doesn't provide an effective understanding of the business. The Sales Director seeks immediate insights from the data to grasp the current situation.
###### Solution: Create consolidated reports in a single Excel file which gives a snapshot of the company's sales.

#### Tool Used: MS Excel
#### Skills used: Data Modelling, Power Query, Power Pivot, DAX

### Overview
##### Following a brief data exploration, here are my initial findings:
######   -The database comprises five tables: customers, targets, markets, products, and sales.
######   -It encompasses 23 markets, 67 products, and 67 customers.
######   -The observation period spans from September 2018 to August 2021.
######   -The transaction data is denominated in USD.

### Steps Taken for Data Preparation:
###### 1. ETL (Extract, Transformation, Load) - Once I've familiarized myself with the fundamental characteristics of the data, I consolidated them into a single Excel file which will allow me to perform the required transformations, ultimately resulting in a straightforward, dependable, and valuable report.
###### 2. Data Modelling - We have five tables, and it's crucial to establish the correct connections between them to ensure data integrity and facilitate meaningful analysis.
